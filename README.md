# Transfer-flows

## Information

European football transfer flow mapping and analysis. In development.

This repo provides interactive mapping for European transfer flows, as well as visualisations and analytical statistics regarding flows to/from/between leagues and clubs.

(Will) include:
- Interactive mapping of European transfer flows
- Transfer flows over time
- Graphical visualisation of flows in/out/between leagues
- Transfer fee and player age/position/origin league

## Getting Started 

## Roadmap

- [ ] Remove duplicated transfers within leagues (and include inter-league transfers)
- [ ] Integrate automatic data retrieval from https://github.com/tim-hy/tmarkt-transfers
- [ ] Include international transfer flows outside of selected leagues (requires matching to external club dataset list)
